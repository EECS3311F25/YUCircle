Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

**Jason:** Since last standup, I put up PR for YUC-9, I am finishing up YUC-14 and YUC-15 as well. There are no blockers on my side at this time.

**Brandon:** Since last standup, I successfully merged my branch (YUC-20) to the main branch with no blockages. Planning to test my features on main with the other features and continue to prepare for the demo.

**Ejaaj:** I have completed the notification feature (YUC-11) and fully merged into the main branch. All that's left is to test with all the other features. 

**David:**

**Alice:** Since the last standup, I was working on the feature to see when students are available. However, there were some issues in merging the edit schedule code and that has led to stalled progress on the availability feature. The feature to see the availability of the students is now done. I just need to test and ensure everything works.
